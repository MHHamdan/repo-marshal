# RepoMarshal — Session Status

_Last updated: 2026-11-10_

## Current phase

**v0.10 is in review: PR #11** (`claude/v0.10-dogfood-binding`). v0.7, v0.8 and v0.9 are merged
(PRs #6, #7, #8; main at 694ebe7). The live signed-waiver test on PR #8 passed: the trusted
`repomarshal/verdict` was PASS with `WAIVED by MHHamdan (ssh-signed)`.

PR #11 fixes the two problems that test exposed:

1. **Advisory dogfood UNKNOWN (c022863).** The verdict step redirected its JSON into the
   checkout; the shell created the file before the judge started, so the verdict job's change set,
   plan hash and tree digest differed from the plan job's and every gate result was rejected as
   unbound. The JSON now goes to `$RUNNER_TEMP`. On PR #11 run 68 (40252453887) the dogfood job
   passes.
2. **Trusted verdict stuck at UNKNOWN on a label race.** Adding the `integration` and
   `ci-workflow` labels in the same second started ci runs 68 and 69. GitHub's concurrency
   cancelled run 69, the higher id. The judge treated any higher-id run as superseding, so run
   68's PASS was skipped ("superseded") and run 69's UNKNOWN (no rm-gate jobs) stayed as the
   status. Fix: a cancelled run never supersedes (`src/repomarshal/ci.py`, `trusted_verdict`);
   an in-progress newer run still does. Tests in `tests/unit/test_ci_trusted.py`.

The trusted verdict runs main's judge, so fix 2 only applies after merge. On PR #11 itself, add
waiver labels one at a time, or re-run ci after both are on.

## Next step

1. Owner: for the new PR #11 head, run `repomarshal waive-sign` for `ci-workflow` (reason must
   name the new ci.yml blob id, `git rev-parse HEAD:.github/workflows/ci.yml | cut -c1-12`) and
   `integration`, post both comments, then remove and re-add the labels **one at a time**
   (a relabel after removal needs the new codes, signed after the removal).
2. Confirm dogfood PASS and `repomarshal/verdict` PASS on the new head; record here; merge #11.
3. Ship 0.1.0 (`docs/guides/release.md`).

Open:
- `commit-identity` push runs fail on GitHub-made merge commits (94fa582, 66ab69c, 694ebe7:
  committer `noreply@github.com`). Owner to choose: merge locally (fast-forward), or allow GitHub
  as committer on two-parent merge commits authored by the owner.
- Lessons from the live test: a label alone does nothing without the signed comment; a comment
  does not re-run CI; removing the label voids earlier codes; every new head or key rotation needs
  a new signature.

## Open questions / blockers

- Resolved: the cloud checkout started with no git remote. `MHHamdan/repo-marshal` is now
  attached with push access, `origin` is added, and `claude/phase1-research` is pushed. The
  commits were rebased onto `origin/main` and their author reset to the owner identity, as
  required by the commit-identity check.
- The GitHub REST API and github.com issue pages return 403 from this environment,
  so upstream **issues, releases pages and star counts were not inspected** via
  GitHub. Git tags were inspected instead.

## Decisions

- Work branch `claude/phase1-research` (session started on `main`; CLAUDE.md
  forbids working directly on the default branch).
- **Keep the name RepoMarshal.** It is unclaimed on PyPI, npm, crates.io and GitHub. Avoid a bare
  `marshal` CLI, package or import: chiruu12/marshal, crates.io `marshal` and the Python standard
  library all use it.
- **Diff-driven check selection is not novel.** Preloop PR #435 already does it with path globs. We
  claim the combination: inferred gate inventory, content signals, reasons for skipped gates, one
  plan from before the work to the verdict, and a typed five-state verdict.
- **Policy is loaded from the BASE commit.** Edits to the policy, CI or agent config are high-risk
  signals, so an agent cannot relax its own requirements.
- **Only gates RepoMarshal itself ran count as evidence.** Agent-reported results are claims.
- **Minimise only expensive gates.** Cheap gates always run, and uncovered files get a conservative
  default. CI stays authoritative. This answers AgentSmith rule R5.
- **No generation of agent-specific config.** The agent-facing interface is MCP stdio plus the CLI.
  Hook shims start with Claude Code `Stop`.
- **v0.1 real adapters:** SkillSpector (security) and Playwright (runtime). Reticle, Chisel, UI Skills,
  UI/UX Pro Max and AgentProof are PLANNED, with no stubs.
- **License: Apache-2.0**, decided by the owner on 2026-10-13.
- **Task text can only add requirements, never remove them.** The diff dominates, and the plan is
  recompiled from the actual diff at completion time.
- **Verdict precedence is BLOCKED > FAIL > UNKNOWN > PASS.** Exit codes are 0 for PASS, 1 for FAIL,
  2 for UNKNOWN and 3 for BLOCKED. SKIPPED, NOT_APPLICABLE and WAIVED are never evidence.
- **Pulling `main` into this branch uses merge, not rebase.** The branch is already pushed, and
  CLAUDE.md forbids rewriting pushed history.
- **v0.3 dogfood ordering:** the judge is installed from BASE before any PR code runs, and gate
  tools come from BASE's dev requirements. A PR build backend could otherwise tamper with git
  state before the judge reads BASE.
- **Waivers are read before gates:** gates run PR code as the same user, so nothing the judge
  trusts is read after the first gate.
- **v0.4 review waivers are rejected outright:** no GitHub API reports whether a review was
  made through an app, and the owner required failing closed when the field is missing.
- **v0.4 one job per gate:** PR code in one job can read the runner's artifact token. Each
  result is therefore cross-checked against GitHub's step conclusions for its own job, which
  PR code in another job cannot change.
- **v0.5 tests the PR head, not GitHub's merge commit:** the trusted verdict binds to the head
  SHA, where the commit status lives. Base drift is handled by "Require branches to be up to
  date" (T37).
- **v0.5 `ci-workflow` waiver:** a PR that changes `ci.yml` cannot bind on its own. A reviewed
  workflow change needs a person's waiver, otherwise a solo maintainer could never merge one
  without bypassing protection.
